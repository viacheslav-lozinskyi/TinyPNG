## Important information:
[![MetaOutput](https://www.metaoutput.net/_functions/watch?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=view-on-github&utm_content=TinyPNG&source=GITHUB&size=128x128&project=TinyPNG&url=https://github.com/viacheslav-lozinskyi/TinyPNG)](https://www.metaoutput.net/)

This extension is working only with installed [MetaOutput](https://www.metaoutput.net/) extension!

## Description:
**TinyPNG** uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your **WEBP**, **JPEG** and **PNG** files.
By selectively decreasing the number of colors in the image, fewer bytes are required to store the data.
The effect is nearly invisible, but it makes a very large difference in file size!

Detailed information about this service is [HERE](https://tinypng.com/).

## Free usage:
This extension is free, but the service which does this optimization isn't free.
It provides compression for 500 free images in month.
Other conversions will be necessary to purchase.
Also, this service is working only with "Developer API key".
It's necessary to get [HERE](https://tinypng.com/developers).

Good news that this service provides the best compression of all alternatives.
Therefore, it makes sense...
